# Chipy Mentorship
 If you are reading this you probably already know about the Chipy Mentorship
 Program. If you don't check it out. LINK. The short verions is one of the
 best meetups in Chicago pairs up a volunteer mentor to guide a mentee
 through building a project of their choice over three months.


# My Project
 I have chosen to build a web application that can help me and other learn
 Mandarin Chinese. Bascially, I want to access a database of characters and
 phrases and have the program tell me what I should study next based on the
 Chinese I already know and how frequently the charaters and phrases are used
 in Chinese.


# My Mentor
I'm really happy that I got paired up with Jordan.  He's been super helpful and
very patient. He even has me doing a workflow similar to *real* development where I 
push to a development branch on github, and he reviews the code before it gets merged
into main.  Also, we both rock older Thinkpads :).


# Preparations
 I thought it would be both unreasonable and unproductive to walk into this
 program without doing any preparation.  So I worked through the the following 
 resources the month prior to the mentorship.

 - Lynda.com's Up and Running with Django (free throuh my local library)
 - The first 6 chapters of Django Core (free on line, $10 dollars for the ebook on amazon.)
 - Team Treehouse's Django Track (free through my local library)
 - First 3 chapters of the Git Book (free online)
 
 I got through a fair chunkc of this material, and I have to say this has been really helpful.
 I did not have any experience with Django prior and it is a fairly big framework to jump into.  

# Progress
I feel like I've made a fair amount of progress so far.  Prior to the post I was able to get 
get the following items done:

- Setup a Repository on GitHub.  
- Setup a Development Environment.
- Learned some PostgreSQL.
- Setup an EC2 and RDS instance on AWS.
- Built a Managment Command to Load the Database.
- Built a Managment Command to Update the Database.
- Implemented Full Text Search Over the Chinese Entries and their Definitions.
- Built Django views and forms to search the dictionary.
- Installed and learned a little Bootstrap3 and django-bootstrap3 to make the site look better.

I've also drafted a fair amount of the coded for the User Accounts and pushed that to GitHub as
so Jordan and I can talk through my approach at one of our weekly meetings.  

# Populating and Searching the Database
Many times when we are taught something new from someone more experienced on the subject all the
information is presented in a very neat package.  A package that hides all the messy first attempts
to from A to B.
